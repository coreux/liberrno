This package contains a reference implementation of errno(3), intended to
conform to the Single Unix Specification, Version 3 (SUSv3).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unless you are a libc developer, do not install this package with a prefix
whose include directory is in your C compiler's header search path.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The installed errno.h defines an errno macro which expands to a call to
__ux_get_errno(); on platforms which support it, this will expand to a
symbol which is weakly-defined by this library. It is intended that a
POSIX threads library will override the implementation to one which returns
the location of the thread-local errno.

errno.h will also include ux/<kernel>/errno.h which defines each of the
required errno values. See SUSv3 for the complete list:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

To build liberrno, first install the include package from:

	https://github.com/coreux/include.git

This package includes the ux/cdefs.h header which is required by errno.h.

If building from a git checkout, run:

$ autoreconf -i

(This may produce some informational messages which can be ignored)

Next, configure liberrno:

$ ./configure --prefix=/path/to/ux

If the liberrno prefix differs from that used to install the include package,
you must specify its location using the --with-ux=... configure option.

Finally, build and install liberrno:

$ make
$ sudo make install [DESTDIR=/path/to/staging/root]

At this time liberrno will not install the built library: it is compiled and
linked as a libtool convenience library intended to be incorporated into a
libc build.
